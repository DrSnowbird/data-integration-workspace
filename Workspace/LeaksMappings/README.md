#Panama Papers
The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorneyâ€“client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The leaked documents were created by Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca;[2] some date back to the 1970s.

The leaked documents illustrate how wealthy individuals, including public officials, are able to keep personal financial information private.While offshore business entities are often not illegal, reporters found that some of the shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, kleptocracy, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions."

##Database released by ICIJ
On 10th May 2016, the ICIJ make available the complete database for download in CSV format. The compressed file size is 41 Mb.
The following image shows the CSV files and relations between them. As we can see the main concepts are Addresses, Intermediaries, Officers, Entities (Offshore Companies) and the relations between them (all_edges.csv).
Paname Papers CSVs files and relations between them.

In general, the structure of the CSV files is easy to understand. all_edges.csv contains the relations between the different nodes that compose the Panama Papers, this CSV file defines 69 types of relations between the entities in total.

##Panama papers into OntoFuhSen vocabulary
The following goals motivated the transformation of the "Panama Papers" data into LiDaKrA Organized Crime vocabulary:
* As dataset example for LiDaKrA project. Notice this data set can be enriched with other open data sources such as DBPedia.
* To validate and extend the Organized Crime vocabulary.

The following image despites the process we followed to transform the CSV files into OntoFuhSen vocabulary for organized crime.

###OntoFuhSen vocabulary
Our vocabulary was extended with concepts, the new concepts: Address, Country, OffshoreCompany, Officer, Intermediary, and Bank.
Note: These changes are still under revision.

The following image despites some of the classes of the vocabulary involved in this process.
